# Quizme

## Description

**

This fun project was a way to display my growing javascript skills. This is an app which asks the user a series of questions within a certain amount of time. With each incorrect answer, 3 seconds are taken away from the timer. Try to complete the quiz as fast as possible and see what the fastest time you can get is!


## Learning Points

This application challenged me greatly. Figuring out how to get the timer working was especially hard for me. I finally, however, learned how to decrement the countdown timer using timeInterval.
